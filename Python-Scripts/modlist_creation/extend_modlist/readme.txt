As the corpus of the novels is now extended, the modlist used for the modernization is a bit outdated and will be extended.
This happens in various steps as follows:

1. First we are going to extend the names list for filtering proper names and location names using a json-File created from the output of querying the MiMoTextBase for characters and locations occuring in the novels: https://tinyurl.com/2p7ubtlr
By clicking on "Download" you can choose the "JSON file"-format.
This will be the input-file for the "extend_names.py"-Script.
